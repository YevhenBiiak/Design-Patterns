#### Description

This app is the result of my learning of design patterns. 

A simple application with a list of patterns grouped by categories.
All the images, as well as the design of the application, were created in Sketch.
Pattern structure images are taken from [refactoring.guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/catalog).
Each pattern has a brief description, popularity, and complexity indicators for Swift developers, and a code example.
The code samples are downloaded from this Git repository and have a specific situation implementation for the ios developer.

## App Features

- Paterns are grouped by pattern types, which includes three categories: creational patterns, structural patterns, and behavioral patterns.
This feature makes it easier for users to find code examples that are relevant to their needs and interests.
- Syntax highlighting for code examples. The app uses regular expressions to highlight different elements of the code, such as keywords, types, strings, and comments.
- Adjustable font size for code examples. Users can adjust the font size for better readability.

## Used Frameworks

- `UIKit` for handling user interactions

## Technology Stack

- `Sketch` - application design
- `Swift`, `Xcode`
- `Storyboard` - create the user interface
- `Playground` - separate each design pattern
- `JSON` as an object to store data
- `Regex` - highlight keywords
